    `The episode was split into ${chunks} chunks (the ~2 minute audio pieces used for transcription). Every chunk was called independently and in parallel — none was told what any other chunk decided. Each call read that chunk's dialogue plus ${p.contextSec}s of dialogue before and after it, with the measured silences (${p.showSilenceMinSec}s or longer) and shot cuts written between the lines, and proposed a best line-and-brand pick plus up to 2 alternatives.`,
    `For every option the model proposed, code found the exact cut time — inside a measured silence after that line (on a shot cut if one falls in it, else its middle), or, if there is none, in the first stretch of the pause with no transcribed word for at least ${t.minSpeechFreeSec}s — and rejected it outright if any of the contexts it reported as nearby is on the brand's never-next-to list or the list that blocks every brand, or if its fit is below ${p.minBrandFit} — a strict floor: fit is the main gate on what airs at all.`,
    `Once every chunk had answered, code chose the highest total quality combination across all of them (${Math.round(scoring.where * 100)}% how good the pause is, ${Math.round(scoring.brandFit * 100)}% brand fit), subject to total ad time under ${Math.round(p.maxAdLoadPct * 100)}% of the episode and never the same brand on two ads next to each other. There is no minimum gap between ads and no target ad count: any two ads clearing the ${p.minBrandFit} fit floor can sit as close together as the content allows, and there is no preference for more ads over fewer either — a chunk with no eligible candidate is simply left empty. No ad plays in the last ${p.noAdLastSec}s of the episode, and none in the first slot either — there is no no-break zone at the start.`,
    `A brand can repeat across the episode, but it costs ${p.brandRepeatPenalty} off a candidate's score for every earlier use of that brand — a tie-break, not a ban, so a repeat still airs when nothing fresher scores close to it — and it is capped outright at ${repeatCap} airings this episode (this length gets ${repeatCap}; the cap only rises to 3 past about 75 minutes). With this catalogue's ${ctx.catalogue.brands.length} brands, some repetition across a longer episode is expected.`,
    `Last, every chosen cut was checked for speech (voice activity ${l.vadSpeechMin} or more rejects it, between ${l.vadQuietMax} and ${l.vadSpeechMin} the audio is re-checked by an LLM). A cut that fails is dropped and the schedule is redrawn without it.`,
    "Reading this file: `breaks` are the ads placed, each with `dialogue` — the line the ad follows and the one that resumes after it, so you can read the moment without cross-referencing anything. `selection` has one line per chunk with the outcome and reason. `placement.chunks` has, per chunk, the exact prompt the model saw, its answer, and every option it proposed with that same `dialogue`, the sensitive contexts the model reported at that option's own line (`contextsNearby`), the cut time, how the cut was found (silence / speechFree), and why it was accepted or rejected — including options that passed every content check but lost to a better schedule elsewhere, or would have repeated a brand past its cap. `settingsUsed` lists the values above. `costSummary` is every API call this video has ever made (across every attempt, including earlier retries) with what it cost, by pipeline stage and by what the call was for.",
